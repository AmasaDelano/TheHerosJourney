--------
Hello, Violet, your instinct is to avoid notice.
--------
Violet, you live in Lakeville, a small village on the edge of Lake Calhoun. You work on the fishing boats, bringing back enough fish each day to feed your small village.

One day, a messenger rides into town. "Citizens of Lakeville, the Baron Damien lays claim to your city. You are now under his rule and will pay taxes and fealty to him."

What do you do?
--------
1) Leave Lakeville to tell the Baron that he doesn't own you
2) Go to work like always and see if anything changes
2
--------
The fish are biting, just like they always are this time of year. It's a good haul.

The next week, the Baron's men arrive. They are soldiers, well-armed and uniformed, with the insignia of the Baron on their jackets.

They say they're here to collect taxes, but they take so much more than that. They eat food they don't pay for, destroy property that isn't theirs, and leer at young men and women.

In the morning, your friend Joseth is missing. His family say that he was taken by Baron Damien's men. They don't know when, or if, he will return.
--------
1) Set out for the Tower immediately
2) Start a fight with the Baron's men
1
--------
You slink into the nearby Black Forest in the night, setting your course straight for the Tower.

The next day, deep in the forest, a man emerges from behind the trees. He's wearing rough clothing.

"My name's Braddeus," he says. "Lakeville's not the first village that Baron Damien's taken control of. He'll stop at nothing until the whole region is under his control. We can't let that happen.

"If you want to stop him and get back Lakeville, you'll have to make it to the Tower."
--------
1) Ask Braddeus for his help
2) Set off for the Tower (you know the way)
1
--------
"I'm sorry, I can't go near the Baron's Tower myself. He and his goons'll be looking for me. But here, you take this." He hands you piece of rolled cloth. "It might be useful." With that, Braddeus disappears into the forest. 

The cloth, once unrolled, looks like some sort of map of a secret entrance into the Baron's Tower. You roll it up again and put it in your pack.

You travel through the Black Forest for several days.

A wide river blocks your path to the Tower. The water is deep and moving fast.
--------
1) Wade through the rushing water
2) Look for another way around
2
--------
You walk along the river's edge until you find an enormous tree trunk lying across the river. It looks as though someone has recently cut it down. You're able to nimbly walk across the log and cross the river.

On the other side, you continue on your way to the Tower.

Your path lies through a thick forest, overgrown and difficult to travel through.

After a day or so, you hear footsteps crashing through the brush. They're getting nearer.
--------
1) Hide in the brush and wait
2) Seek out the footsteps
1
--------
You find a clump of bushes to hide inside. As the footsteps get closer, you see two dozen armed of the Baron's men tramping through the underbrush.

You hold your breath, but one of them stumbles just too close to you.

"What do we have here?" he says. He grabs you roughly by the shoulder and jerks you to your feet. "Well, well, well, the Baron will be THRILLED to meet you!" Cheers erupt.

Two more men grab your arms and bind them. You're taken to a camp in the woods an hour away. The Baron's men tie you to a tree and spend the night drinking and making coarse jokes.

Most of them have fallen asleep, but there is still one awake, on guard, staring into the fire. He isn't looking directly at you, you could try to escape while he isn't looking. What do you do?
--------
1) Wiggle out of your bonds and sneak into the night
2) Wait until morning for a chance to escape
1
--------
It takes you over an hour, but you eventually feel the bonds loosening enough that you can slip out of them. The lone guard is still staring into the fire, poking at it with his sword and humming.

You grab your pack silently and disappear into the night, using the stars to head in the direction of the Tower.

The next day, a small creature runs across your path. You almost step on it.

You squat down to look at it. It seems like some sort of squirrel, but it's eyes are ruby red. It sits still, staring at you, alert
--------
1) Give it some of your food
2) Ignore it
1
--------
The squirrel seems appreciative, and chirps happily. It looks deep into your eyes, then it scampers off into the forest. 

Late in the day, you hear a voice calling out through the forest. You hide immediately, but then realize the voice seems to be that of a young girl. You can see her walking alone, calling out for her cat. What do you do?
--------
1) Reveal yourself and offer to help
2) Wait until she's gone and continue
1
--------
You step out from behind your tree, startling the girl briefly. She seems thrilled to have the help. She tells you her name is Ashlyne, and her cat's name is Sniffles.

Together, it takes you a few ours to find Sniffles. Ashlyne thanks you profusely for your help. Then, you continue on your way to the Tower.

You're being careful, but you don't notice a well-concealed pit before it's too late. You step through the thin covering of leaves and ferns and fall right through to the bottom, landing with a crunch.

Your leg hurts. You look up: the pit's sides are sheer hard dirt, about 15 feet deep. There are no roots, nothing down there with you besides dirt and whatever you have with you.
--------
1) Try to climb out
2) Call for help
1
--------
There's nothing to grab onto, but you dig your fingernails and toes into the dirt as best you can, trying to find rocks or roots to hold onto.

You fall a few times, but you make progress. The pain in your leg blends with the pain in the rest of your body. Very slowly, you make your way to the top. Your fingers are bleeding, your wrists hurt.

As the sun sets, you see a small hut ahead of you, nestled between the trees. You pause, considering whether or not to investigate, but before you can decide, a group of men and women dressed like Braddeus steps out from behind the trees, surrounding you.

"What are YOU doing here?" one of them asks you.
--------
1) Ask them what THEY are doing here
2) Tell them you're here to free Lakeville from Baron Damien
2
--------
"We're on the same side then! Have you met our friend Braddeus? He's out somewhere, fighting against the Baron's influence."

You spend the night with the resistance fighters. The Baron's men, they tell you, are only working for him because he pays them handsomely. If you can find a way to stop the Baron's men from being paid, most of his influence over the region will be gone.

They have plans to attack one of the Baron's outposts tomorrow, which should draw most of his men away from the Tower, allowing you to get inside more easily.

In the morning, you set off for the Tower again.

As you head toward the Tower, late that day, on your left, you see a field of berry bushes, overflowing with red berries. Your food is running low, and you feel hungry.
--------
1) Gather and enjoy some berries
2) Avoid the patch and press on
1
--------
You gather and eat some of the berries. They are delicious.

You begin to feel sleepy, and soon fall asleep in the middle of the berry patch. When you wake up, the sun is high in the sky. You have no idea how long you've been asleep; it could have been days!

You finally arrive at the base of the Tower. Staying out of view of any of the Baron's men, you find the hidden path into the Tower on Braddeus's map. The hidden path leads underground, and comes out into a tall, well-decorated corridor inside the Tower. You look around for any sign of Joseth.

The Baron is walking down the hall with one of his men. You find a place to hide, and you can hear them talking.

"...if they resist, remind them that, if the kingdoms from the north attack, they will not be able to defend themselves. Under our rule, we will provide them with protection against invasion. What is that safety worth to them? . . ."

The voices fade away as they turn a corner and are gone.

You find Joseth locked in a dungeon with a bunch of other young people. It seems they've been locked up here for some future purpose of the Baron. You set them all free.

Searching in the Tower, you finally find the treasury. You take out the lone guard, and go inside. Several heavy chests of gold are inside. You dump them out the window into a lake outside the Tower. The Baron's gold is gone. You leave the Tower.

As you leave, Baron Damien spots you leaving. "After her!" he shouts to his men, and they begin to chase after you. You sprint into the forest as fast as you can.

The Baron's men are chasing you through the Black Forest on your way back to Lakeville. If they catch you, there's no telling what they might do to you. How do you attempt to avoid their notice at night?
--------
1) Dig holes to sleep inside
2) Travel through the night to stay ahead of them
2
--------
You push on through the night. You're exhausted by the time you reach Lakeville, but you are ahead of the Baron's men.

You finally return to Lakeville. The people have been under the rule of the Baron's men since you left.

You organize a secret meeting at night to rally the people together. You lead the people in a revolt against the Baron's men. Drunk and caught off guard by armed civilians, they're not sure what to do. A few of them are killed before they retreat, leaving the town forever.

The next day, the reinforcements arrive who were pursuing you. Lakeville easily chases them off.

Lakeville is now free! Your fellow citizens are eagerly offering you a position of leadership: they want to make you the Chief of Lakeville. What do you do?
--------
1) Go back to your old job, fishing
2) Take the new job as Chief of Lakeville
1
--------
The lake is peaceful and calm, and the fish are biting just like they always have. Lakeville's freedom allows things to go back to the way that they were. But you know that, if ever another Baron tried to take control of Lakeville again, you and your neighbors would be ready for them.

--------
THE END
