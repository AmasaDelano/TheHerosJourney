"CTA1",,"{name}, you live in Lakeville, a small village on the edge of Lake Calhoun. You work on the fishing boats, bringing back enough fish each day to feed your small village.

One day, a messenger rides into town. ""Citizens of Lakeville, the {character:antagonist:baron:baron} {character:baron:name} lays claim to your city. You are now under {character:baron:possPronoun} rule and will pay taxes and fealty to {character:baron:objPronoun}.""

What do you do?","Leave Lakeville to tell the {character:baron:baron} that {character:baron:subPronoun} doesn't own you","Go to work like always and see if anything changes","You set out for the {character:baron:baron}'s home, the Tower.

Deep in the Black Forest, a {character:mentor:sexAge:ranger} emerges from behind the trees. {character:mentor:subPronoun:cap}'s wearing rough clothing.{|MTM|}","The fish are biting, just like they always are this time of year. It's a good haul.{|ROC|}"
"ROC1","character:baron","The next week, the {character:baron:baron}'s men arrive. They are soldiers, well-armed and uniformed, with the insignia of the {character:baron:baron} on their jackets.

They say they're here to collect taxes, but they take so much more than that. They eat food they don't pay for, destroy property that isn't theirs, and leer at young men and women.

In the morning, your friend {character:bestfriend:name:stolen} is missing. {character:stolen:possPronoun:cap} family say that {character:stolen:subPronoun} was taken by {character:baron:baron} {character:baron:name}'s men. They don't know when, or if, {character:stolen:subPronoun} will return.","Set out for the Tower immediately","Start a fight with the {character:baron:baron}'s men","You slink into the nearby Black Forest in the night, setting your course straight for the Tower.

""I'll take care of {objPronoun},"" you hear a voice say. Rough hands carry you out of town into the Black Forest. You pass out.

You wake up the next day, deep in the Black Forest. A {character:mentor:sexAge:ranger} sits under a nearby tree. As you open your eyes, {character:ranger:subPronoun} says, ""Hope you appreciate I saved your life. That was kind of a stupid fight to start, you know?""{|DONE|}"

"CTT1",,"A wide river blocks your path to the Tower. The water is deep and moving fast.","Wade through the rushing water","Look for another way around","You wade through the rushing water. It comes up to your armpits. You hold your pack above your head.

It takes every ounce of your strength, but you make it across. On the other side, you're soaked to the bone and exhausted. You rest for an hour while your clothes dry.

Once you're ready, you continue on your way to the Tower.{|DONE|}","You walk along the river's edge until you find an enormous tree trunk lying across the river. It looks as though someone has recently cut it down. You're able to nimbly walk across the log and cross the river.

"BOTW1","character:baron","Your path lies through a thick forest, overgrown and difficult to travel through.

After a day or so, you hear footsteps crashing through the brush. They're getting nearer.","Hide in the brush and wait","Seek out the footsteps","You find a clump of bushes to hide inside. As the footsteps get closer, you see two dozen armed of the {character:baron:baron}'s men tramping through the underbrush.

You hold your breath, but one of them stumbles just too close to you.

""What do we have here?"" he says. He grabs you roughly by the shoulder and jerks you to your feet. ""Well, well, well, the {character:baron:baron} will be THRILLED to meet you!""

"BOTW1a","character:baron","Two more men grab your arms and bind them. You're taken to a camp in the woods an hour away. The {character:baron:baron}'s men tie you to a tree and spend the night drinking and making coarse jokes.

Most of them have fallen asleep, but there is still one awake, on guard, staring into the fire. He isn't looking directly at you, you could try to escape while he isn't looking. What do you do?","Wiggle out of your bonds and sneak into the night","Wait until morning for a chance to escape","It takes you over an hour, but you eventually feel the bonds loosening enough that you can slip out of them. The lone guard is still staring into the fire, poking at it with his sword and humming.

You grab your pack silently and disappear into the night, using the stars to head in the direction of the Tower.{|DONE|}","You close your eyes and eventually fall into a fitful sleep.

Hours later you feel someone removing your bonds. It's still night out. You turn to look and see {character:ranger:name}'s face. ""Didn't think I'd find YOU when I came to investigate. Stay quiet."" {character:ranger:subPronoun:cap} finishes cutting your bonds with {character:ranger:possPronoun} knife, and the two of you slip into the night.

"ROT1",,"The next day, a small creature runs across your path. You almost step on it.

You squat down to look at it. It seems like some sort of squirrel, but it's eyes are ruby red. It sits still, staring at you, alert","Give it some of your food","Ignore it","The squirrel seems appreciative, and chirps happily. It looks deep into your eyes, then it scampers off into the forest. {|DONE|}","The squirrel watches you as you leave, then scampers off."
"ROT2",,"Late in the day, you hear a voice calling out through the forest. You hide immediately, but then realize the voice seems to be that of a young {character:child:sexAge:petowner}.

What do you do?","Reveal yourself and offer to help","Wait until {character:petowner:subPronoun}'s gone and continue","You step out from behind your tree, startling the {character:petowner:sexAge} briefly. {character:petowner:subPronoun:cap} seems thrilled to have the help. {character:petowner:subPronoun:cap} tells you {character:petowner:possPronoun} name is {character:petowner:name}, and {character:petowner:possPronoun} cat's name is Sniffles.

"ROT3",,"You're being careful, but you don't notice a well-concealed pit before it's too late. You step through the thin covering of leaves and ferns and fall right through to the bottom, landing with a crunch.

Your leg hurts. You look up: the pit's sides are sheer hard dirt, about 15 feet deep. There are no roots, nothing down there with you besides dirt and whatever you have with you.","Try to climb out","Call for help","There's nothing to grab onto, but you dig your fingernails and toes into the dirt as best you can, trying to find rocks or roots to hold onto.

You fall a few times, but you make progress. The pain in your leg blends with the pain in the rest of your body. Very slowly, you make your way to the top. Your fingers are bleeding, your wrists hurt.{|DONE|}","Your voice rings out into the forest. No one answers.

After a few minutes, you hear skittering and see the squirrel peek its head into view. Then it disappears.

A minute later, a vine woven from ferns and grasses drops down into the pit with you. The squirrel reappears, it's red eyes flashing, before it disappears again.

You climb easily out of the pit. The squirrel is nowhere to be seen.{|DONE|}"
"MWG1","character:baron|character:ranger","As the sun sets, you see a small hut ahead of you, nestled between the trees. You pause, considering whether or not to investigate, but before you can decide, a group of men and women dressed like {character:ranger:name} steps out from behind the trees, surrounding you.

""What are YOU doing here?"" one of them asks you.","Ask them what THEY are doing here","Tell them you're here to free Lakeville from {character:baron:baron} {character:baron:name}","""We're fighting against the {character:baron:baron}'s influence, to free the villages he's conquered from his control.""

They have plans to attack one of the {character:baron:baron}'s outposts tomorrow, which should draw most of {character:baron:possPronoun} men away from the Tower, allowing you to get inside more easily.
